## Current State

Attached are three files containing three JSON objects:

* Object1.json
* Object2.json
* Object3.json

The tree structure of each object is identical, except that each item in each JSON object contains a different value for the ```"value"``` key; e.g.:

* ```"value":"2191"```
* ```"value":"2336"```
* ```"value":"2447"```

## Future State

Using the programming language du jour of your choosing, please write some code that will combine all three objects into a single object, where the "value" node contains the sum from all three objects. In the examples cited above (2191 + 2336 + 2447 = 6974), this particular node would be ```"value":"6974"```. All other structural hierarchy needs to remain in-tact.

Not required, but if you can produce a .json file containing the output of the merge, that would help us expedite your results.

## Extra Credit

If you want to dress up the results in a visually pleasing format, feel free! This could be HTML, JSX, (S)CSS, etc.
